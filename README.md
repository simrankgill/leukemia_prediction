# Leukemia Cell Classification Using CNNs

### Overview
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, disrupting the body's ability to produce healthy blood cells. It is characterized by the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells that cannot effectively fight infections and crowd out healthy red blood cells and platelets.
Among children, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common cancers, accounting for about 25% of pediatric cancer diagnoses. Differentiating leukemic cells from normal cells under a microscope is challenging due to their morphological similarities. This project addresses that challenge using image classification techniques powered by deep learning.

### Problem Statement
Task: Build an image classification model to distinguish between normal and leukemic blood cells using microscopic cell images.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:

### Leukemia Classification Dataset
It consists of microscopic images labeled as either normal or leukemia cells.

### Objectives
* Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify microscopic cell images.
* Apply image preprocessing and data augmentation to improve generalization performance.
* Evaluate model performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Motivation
* Early detection of leukemia is critical for effective treatment. However, manual microscopic examination is time-consuming, expertise-dependent, and prone to human error. Automating the detection process with machine learning models:
* Enhances diagnostic accuracy
* Reduces clinical workload
* Improves accessibility in low-resource settings
* This project aims to demonstrate how deep learning can support healthcare professionals in identifying leukemia at an early stage, improving patient outcomes.

### Tools & Technologies
* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* OpenCV / PIL for image processing
* scikit-learn for evaluation metrics
