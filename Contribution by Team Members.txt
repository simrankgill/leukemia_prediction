------------Contributions by Team Members------------

Simran Gill
•	Developed load_data function - allows of reading through files to load images into arrays
•	Exploratory Data Analysis – displaying images by Cancer or Normal cells for comparison 
•	Pre-processing – Contributions to pre-processing data, rescale, data-split
•	Augmentation – testing different augmentation for train set to help with model improvements
•	Fine tuning model – tried different models to see if accuracy increases without overfitting
•	Model evaluation – precision, recall, and confusion matrix 

Erica Robeen
•Built an initial 3 layer CNN model that team iterated on and improved (from loading data, EDA, to the fine-tuned model)
•Contributed to slides

Mauricio Perez
•	Edited some functions (load_data, augment_data and splitting data in training and validation)
•	Created a few visuals for images and data
•	Created a few experiments based on the baseline model and fine-tuned model to test different hyperparameters
•	Made a baseline deck for sharing results and methodology
•	Did background research on models and other methodologies previous people have done
